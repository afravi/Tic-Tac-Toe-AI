Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
==============

Synopsis
----------
The project is intended to demonstrate some artificial intelligence technique through the minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithm on TicTacToe board.


Code Example
------------
Run java compiler on the code

    java TicTacToeAI OXX___O__

Sample output

    Initial board:
    OXX
    ___
    O__

    Game Result:-1
    Moves considered without alpha-beta pruning: 92

    Game Result:-1
    Moves considered with alpha-beta pruning: 22
    Alpha cuts: 10
    Beta cuts: 8


Motivation
--------------
This project was created to quickly experiment with artificial intelligence techniques.
