Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
==============

Synopsis
----------
The project is intended to demonstrate artificial intelligence techniques by finding a winner of a TicTacToe game using the minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithm.


Code Example
------------
Run java compiler on the code  
    `java TicTacToeAI OXX___O__`

Sample output
`
    Initial board:
    OXX
    ___
    O__

    Game Result:-1
    Moves considered without alpha-beta pruning: 92

    Game Result:-1
    Moves considered with alpha-beta pruning: 22
    Alpha cuts: 10
    Beta cuts: 8
`
Installation
------------
1. Download the repository to a local directory  
2. Build the java files  
`javac TicTacToeAI`
3. The program is now ready to run

Motivation
--------------
This project was created to quickly experiment with artificial intelligence techniques like minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms.
